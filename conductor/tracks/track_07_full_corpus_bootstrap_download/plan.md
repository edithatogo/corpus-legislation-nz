# Plan - Full Corpus Bootstrap Download

## Tasks
- [x] Confirm runner disk budget (docs/runtime_capacity_runbook.md: 25 GB min, 50 GB preferred).
- [x] Restore current Hugging Face state before incremental runs (merge_policy=restore_merge in workflow).
- [ ] Run full seed sync via GitHub Actions (68 batches of 500 work IDs each).
- [x] Use staged batches (pre-split in generated/historical-discovery-27313765016/batches/).
- [x] Preserve sync state after each batch (merge_policy=restore_merge).
- [x] Validate, manifest, coverage-report commands available and tested.
- [ ] Review missing text, XML URLs, failed versions, and ephemeral identifiers per batch.

## Current state

- `seeds/work_ids.txt` exists (33,693 work IDs, Track 04). Root blocker resolved.
- All 68 reviewed historical batch files exist in `seeds/reviewed/` (0001-0068).
- Historical batches 0001-0003 confirmed-uploaded to `edithatogo/corpus-legislation-nz-historical`.
- Batch 0004 no-upload triggered: run `27362894765`.
- Full live corpus sync (68 batches) must run via GitHub Actions (no local API key or disk).
- Expected 4-6 weeks of batched historical uploads at current pace.
- 2026-06-21 live dispatch check: `gh auth status` reports the active
  `edithatogo` keyring token is invalid, so this shell cannot trigger or inspect
  the GitHub Actions run until GitHub CLI authentication is refreshed.
- 2026-06-21 final serial bootstrap dispatched after GitHub CLI auth was
  refreshed: run `27898963687`,
  `https://github.com/edithatogo/corpus-legislation-nz/actions/runs/27898963687`.
  Inputs: `seed_work_ids_path=seeds/work_ids.txt`, `batch_size=500`,
  `start_batch=1`, `end_batch=68`, `merge_policy=restore_merge`,
  `min_seconds_between_requests=0.5`, `max_parallel=1`, `serial=true`,
  `max_works=none`.
- 2026-06-21 period-sharding decision: the current serial run remains the
  full-bootstrap evidence path, but period-level agent handoff is now split to
  Track 36. Track 36 owns canonical time-period shards, annual recent/API-native
  shards, per-period checkpoint artifacts, and period-level review status.
- 2026-06-21 latest live check: run `27898963687` remains `in_progress`.
  `plan` completed successfully, `batch` was skipped because `serial=true`,
  and `serial` is still running `Sync all bootstrap batches sequentially`.
- 2026-06-29 follow-up check: run `27898963687` completed with conclusion
  `cancelled`. The `serial` job was cancelled during
  `Sync all bootstrap batches sequentially` after about six hours, and the
  validate/manifest/coverage/artifact steps were skipped. This confirms that a
  single all-batch serial run is not viable on GitHub-hosted runners.
- 2026-06-29 remediation: added `nzlc merge-bootstrap-artifacts` and a
  `merge_batches` job to `.github/workflows/full_corpus_bootstrap.yml`.
  Hosted runs should now use `serial=false`; each batch uploads a shard
  artifact, and the merge job assembles a standard
  `full-corpus-bootstrap-download` artifact with root `data/`, manifests,
  sync state, Parquet, raw content, and review report.
- 2026-06-30 quota-safe continuation: cancelled replacement full-range run
  `28409376276` and added
  `.github/workflows/scheduled_full_corpus_bootstrap_batches.yml` to resume at
  batch 0024. The dispatcher uses the NZ Legislation API daily key limit of
  10,000 requests and schedules at 80% utilisation (8,000 requests/day).
- 2026-06-30 batch 0024 continuation evidence: run `28410878072`
  completed successfully and `nzlc review-full-corpus-bootstrap` passed against
  the downloaded `full-corpus-bootstrap-download` artifact. Review counts:
  969 records in `records.jsonl`, manifest, and coverage; validation OK; 0
  records failed; 483 XML-to-HTML fallback warnings; manifest SHA-256
  `0c41ca5a4c793247e0c94ca612992c4d2a675f80917eee1796410b9f38df4cb6`.
  Sync state recorded 500 works checked, 874 versions checked, 874 records
  added, and 12 Parquet files written. This supports a two-batch daily window:
  approximate upper-bound API requests were 2,731, so two similar batches stay
  under the 8,000 request/day target while three fallback-heavy batches could
  approach the cap. Next daily window is batches 0025-0026 with
  `max_parallel=2`.
- 2026-06-30 batches 0025-0026 continuation evidence: run `28418448745`
  completed successfully with `max_parallel=2`, and
  `nzlc review-full-corpus-bootstrap` passed against the downloaded
  `full-corpus-bootstrap-download` artifact. Review counts: 1,677 records in
  `records.jsonl`, manifest, and coverage; validation OK; 0 records failed;
  966 XML-to-HTML fallback warnings; manifest SHA-256
  `98899d1e183898240f4eb83a78e9397cd757f91f79fa9ed71a4957dc9ed975dd`.
  Merged sync state recorded 1,000 works checked, 1,582 versions checked,
  1,582 records added, and 22 Parquet files written. Next daily window is
  batches 0027-0028 with `max_parallel=2`.
- 2026-07-01 scheduler utilisation update: the automatic dispatcher initially
  started at batch 0029 with schedule day 0 on 2026-07-01, after manual
  continuation covered batches 0024-0028. The conservative budget remains
  10,000 API requests/day, 80% utilisation (8,000 usable requests/day), 500
  work IDs/batch, and 8 requests/work ID budget, which yields two guaranteed
  batches/day. After batches 0029-0030 succeeded, the scheduler was retargeted
  to start at batch 0031 on 2026-07-02 with `target_batches_per_day=3` and
  `max_parallel=3`: two batches are within the conservative budget and the
  third is an opportunistic catch-up batch. Batches 0031 and 0032 were then
  run manually in the same NZ quota window, so the scheduler was retargeted
  again to start at batch 0033 on 2026-07-02 to avoid duplicate dispatches.
  If an opportunistic batch fails or exceeds quota, resume or rerun that batch
  in the next daily window before advancing.
- 2026-07-01 batch 0028 repair evidence: run `28464210390` completed
  successfully after the dated-URL fallback patch. Local review of the
  downloaded `full-corpus-bootstrap-download` artifact passed: 1,389 records in
  `records.jsonl`, manifest, and coverage; validation OK; 0 records failed;
  474 warnings, including 473 XML-to-HTML fallback warnings; manifest SHA-256
  `6622c7e7c1256cfe73096cc31f3c72576ff9ffa5855d378e64b241003779c073`.
  Sync state recorded 1,294 versions checked, 1,294 records added, 0 failed,
  and 10 Parquet files written. The stale
  `act_public_1992_27_en_1992-04-10` URL was recovered through the
  `1992-04-10A` alternate and now maps to the same content hash as the
  `act_public_1992_27_en_1992-04-10A` version.
- 2026-07-01 batches 0029-0030 continuation evidence: run `28496717521`
  completed successfully with `max_parallel=2`. Batch 0029 completed in
  1h00m44s, batch 0030 completed in 1h22m45s, and the `merge_batches` job
  completed in 53s. Local review of the downloaded merged
  `full-corpus-bootstrap-download` artifact passed: 3,455 records in
  `records.jsonl`, manifest, and coverage; validation OK; 0 records failed;
  940 warnings, including 937 XML-to-HTML fallback warnings; 0 browser
  fallback warnings; manifest SHA-256
  `62e2bb8664404ff10abc32e8830aa9dac8a38f38e49ac3e5614a0ad89f5d21ec`.
  Merged sync state recorded 3,397 versions checked, 3,360 records added,
  36 records unchanged, 1 record changed, 0 failed, and 23 Parquet files
  written. The downloaded local review report was written to ignored generated
  evidence path `generated/full-corpus-bootstrap/review_report_28496717521_merged.json`.
- 2026-07-01 manual third-batch evidence: run `28502342645` covered batch
  0031 on `main` and completed successfully. Batch 0031 completed in 49m14s,
  and the `merge_batches` job completed in 38s. Local review of the downloaded
  merged `full-corpus-bootstrap-download` artifact passed: 1,702 records in
  `records.jsonl`, manifest, and coverage; validation OK; 0 records failed;
  78 warnings, including 77 XML-to-HTML fallback warnings; 0 browser fallback
  warnings; manifest SHA-256
  `203559ef1425477f761a16e22b99c435b2ba52038fc122e4f495ed5cecc71568`.
  Merged sync state recorded 1,627 versions checked, 1,607 records added,
  20 records unchanged, 0 failed, and 12 Parquet files written.
- 2026-07-01 manual fourth-batch evidence: run `28505079812` covered batch
  0032 on `main` and completed successfully. Local review of the downloaded
  merged `full-corpus-bootstrap-download` artifact passed: 1,541 records in
  `records.jsonl`, manifest, and coverage; validation OK; 0 records failed;
  0 warnings; manifest SHA-256
  `88579cb57d688b3db3ea114734a3538229ec33824de74e1fb8f67af8255e45a1`.
  Merged sync state recorded 500 works checked, 1,446 versions checked,
  1,446 records added, 0 records unchanged, 0 failed, and 13 Parquet files
  written. The next scheduled window is batches 0033-0035, with batch 0035
  treated as the opportunistic third batch.
- 2026-07-02 daily maximum probe: manual continuation runs covered batches
  0033-0042 successfully before the next scheduled dispatcher could take over.
  Runs `28510037176`, `28511889179`, `28513240315`, `28514259299`,
  `28515266056`, `28516266938`, and `28517300595` covered batches 0033-0039
  individually on `main`. Run `28518390359` then attempted batches 0040-0044
  with `max_parallel=3`; batches 0040, 0041, and 0042 validated and uploaded
  their batch artifacts, while batches 0043 and 0044 completed sync but failed
  the `Validate, manifest, and coverage-report` step. The failed reports
  surfaced `missing_xml_url` and `ephemeral_identifier` records for
  `secondary-legislation_agency-drafted_~...` stable IDs, not an API quota
  or runner-timeout failure. The current observed fully validated daily maximum
  is therefore six batches for the new NZ quota window: boundary batch 0037
  plus batches 0038-0042. Scheduler defaults now resume at batch 0043 on
  2026-07-03 NZ time with `target_batches_per_day=6` and `max_parallel=3`.
  Batch 0043 should be retried first; if the validation failure persists,
  classify or remediate the agency-drafted secondary-legislation records before
  advancing the schedule.

## Implementation automation added 2026-06-12

- Added `.github/workflows/full_corpus_bootstrap.yml` with manual batch splitting, disk-budget enforcement, HF restore, staged `nzlc sync`, validation, manifest, coverage-report, and artifact evidence.
- See `docs/full_corpus_operations.md` for the operator inputs and review
  sequence for this workflow.
- Parallel mode supports reviewed batch evidence; `serial=true` preserves one cumulative `data/` directory on a sufficiently large runner.
- Track remains `in_progress` until a full seed sync run produces and records final evidence.

## Full corpus bootstrap pilot run evidence (2026-06-12)

Run: `27396415830` (triggered via `gh workflow run`)
- Inputs: `batch_size=500`, `start_batch=1`, `end_batch=1`, `min_seconds_between_requests=1.0`, `serial=false`, `max_parallel=1`, `max_works=none`
- Plan job: completed (12s) with batch_count=1 for 500 work IDs
- Batch 0001 job: ran from 05:24:07Z to 10:38:47Z (5h14m40s)
  - Sync bootstrap batch step: 05:24:18Z to 10:38:46Z (5h14m28s)
  - Validate, manifest, and coverage-report: completed
  - Upload batch bootstrap artifact: completed
  - Batch summary: completed
- Serial job: skipped (serial=false)

### Sync performance analysis

500 work IDs (batch_0001: early imperial acts 1539-1730) took 5h14m at 1.0s pacing.
This is ~37 seconds per work ID, far above the ~3s expected from pacing alone.

Root cause: NZ Legislation API rate limiting. The `_sleep_for_low_quota` method
triggers when `X-RateLimit-Remaining` drops below `rate_limit_low_watermark=10`,
sleeping for `reset_time / remaining` seconds per call. Once quota is depleted,
the client waits for the full quota reset window (typically 1 hour) before
continuing, causing the exponential slowdown.

### Recommendation for full 68-batch run

1. Use `serial=true` with one cumulative data directory (24h runner timeout, 50GB+ disk)
2. Set `min_seconds_between_requests=0.5` for initial batches, then reduce to 0.2
   after confirming no 429/403 rate limiting
3. Expected wall-clock time: 8-15 hours for the full 33,693 work IDs at 0.5s pacing
   with observed API latency
4. Monitor `X-RateLimit-Remaining` and `X-RateLimit-Reset` headers; if quota
   exhaustion is frequent, contact NZ Legislation API support for a higher tier
5. Alternative: process through the historical bootstrap workflow
   (`historical_hf_upload.yml`) which has been proven at 500-work scale with
   batches 0001-0003

## Code improvements applied 2026-06-13

The following production-hardening changes were made to support reliable 68-batch processing:

### Critical: quota sleep cap (`config.py`, `nz_api.py`)

Added `rate_limit_max_sleep_seconds=60.0` to cap `_sleep_for_low_quota`. Previously,
a quota-exhausted API key with `remaining=1` and `reset=3600s` could sleep 30+ minutes
per work ID (~1800s). The cap limits the maximum individual sleep to 60s, preventing
multi-hour stalls while still respecting the API quota system.

### Logging guard: `_download_first_available_format` (`cli.py`)

Added empty-content detection: if `download_url` returns zero bytes, the code now
raises an exception, triggering the XML->HTML fallback path instead of silently
returning empty content.

### Seed file warning: `_load_seed_work_ids` (`cli.py`)

Added a log warning when the seed work-IDs file exists but contains zero usable
(non-comment, non-empty) lines, preventing silent batch processing of empty batches.

### Serial mode progress tracking (`.github/workflows/full_corpus_bootstrap.yml`)

Added batch-level progress counters (`Processing batch 17/68`) to the serial batch
loop, providing real-time monitoring for the ~8-15 hour cumulative run.

### Extended test coverage

- **Rate limit tests** (`test_nz_api.py`): 9 new tests covering capped quota sleep,
  `_retry_after_seconds` invalid header fallback, `download_url` retries on 429/403/5xx,
  quota pause in download path, missing/expired header edge cases.
- **Download fallback tests** (`test_cli_download.py`): 5 new tests for
  `_download_first_available_format` covering XML success, XML->HTML fallback, both fail,
  HTML-only, and no formats available.
- **Coverage report tests** (`test_cli_coverage.py`): 3 new tests for empty corpus,
  multi-type records with risk indicators, and history append.
- **HF sync test** (`test_hf_sync.py`): prune stale paths test added.

All 65 tests pass; ruff lint clean.

## Test environment isolation applied 2026-06-16

After merging the 2026-06-13 hardening, the full pytest run on a developer
workstation exposed 34 pre-existing failures caused by user-shell `NZLC_*`
environment variables leaking into the test process and tripping
`pydantic_settings` list-field validation. These failures were independent of
the hardening work and surfaced only when the developer's shell exported
`NZLC_SEARCH_TERMS=law,act,...` style CSV values.

### Fix: tests/conftest.py autouse session fixture

Added a session-scoped autouse fixture (`_isolate_settings_env`) that pops the
known `NZLC_*`, `NZ_LEGISLATION_*`, `HF_TOKEN`, and `HF_HUB_TOKEN` env vars
before any test runs, so `Settings()` resolves to its declared defaults.

### Result

- `uv run pytest -q -p no:cacheprovider tests` reports **122 passed** in ~8s.
- `uv run ruff check tests/conftest.py` reports **All checks passed**.
- 5 pre-existing ruff findings in `embeddings.py` (D205/D212/D400/D415) and
  `utils.py` (I001) are unrelated to this track and remain on `main`; they are
  tracked separately.

## Artifact review gate added 2026-06-21

- Added `nzlc review-full-corpus-bootstrap` to review a downloaded
  `full_corpus_bootstrap.yml` artifact before any completeness claim.
- The review gate checks for `records.jsonl`, validation, manifest, coverage,
  and sync-state artifacts; records failed; failed-version warnings; manifest
  hash presence; manifest and coverage record-count agreement with
  `records.jsonl`; and missing text, missing XML URL, and ephemeral identifier
  risk indicators.
- The command writes `generated/full-corpus-bootstrap/review_report.json` by
  default and exits non-zero when required evidence is missing or failed.
- 2026-06-21 review fix: non-zero risk indicators and manifest/count
  mismatches now fail the review and require triage before Track 07 completion.
- Focused validation passed:
  `.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest -q -p no:cacheprovider tests\test_bootstrap_review.py tests\smoke\test_cli_smoke.py -q`
  reported 20 passed.
- Lint passed:
  `.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m ruff check --no-cache src\nz_legislation_corpus\bootstrap_review.py src\nz_legislation_corpus\cli.py tests\test_bootstrap_review.py tests\smoke\test_cli_smoke.py tests\conftest.py`.
- Test fixture hardening: `tests/conftest.py` now falls back from locked
  `test-tmp/` to `.tmp/test-tmp/` after a writability probe, preserving
  repo-local test temp directories on OneDrive-backed worktrees.


## Remaining operator tasks

1. Monitor dispatched run `27898963687` until the `serial` job completes.
2. Dispatch a hosted `serial=false` full bootstrap run for all 68 batches, or
   run `serial=true` only on a local/self-hosted runner with runtime above the
   hosted six-hour ceiling.
3. After the hosted batch run completes, download
   `full-corpus-bootstrap-download`: `data/records.jsonl`,
   `data/manifests/`, `data/_state/`, `data/parquet/`, and `data/raw_xml/`.
4. Run `nzlc review-full-corpus-bootstrap --artifact-root <downloaded-artifact>`
   and review `generated/full-corpus-bootstrap/review_report.json`.
5. Review `sync_state.json` for failed versions and XML-to-HTML fallback warnings.
6. Update tracks.md with final evidence (run URL, manifest SHA, record counts).
7. Mark Task 3 [x] and Task 7 [x] after review.

## Deferred to Track 36

- Generate period-specific seed files and a period manifest.
- Verify the API-native/recent boundary year before making recent shards annual.
- Add per-period checkpoint artifacts so another agent can start work as soon
  as a period completes.
- Add or extend the review gate for single-period artifacts.
